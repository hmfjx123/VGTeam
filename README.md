Welcome to the official repository of the VGTeam! This repository contains the implementation details for our paper titled "*Communicative Agents for Video Generation based on Large Language Models (LLMs)*".

### About the Project
Our project explores the innovative intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and video generation techniques. By leveraging the power of LLMs, we aim to create communicative agents capable of generating compelling video content based on textual descriptions.

### Current Status
Implementation Details: We are in the process of updating and refining the codebase. More comprehensive code and documentation will be provided soon.
Experimental Results & Data: Some of our key experimental results and datasets have been uploaded for public access. Feel free to explore and use them for your research.

### Repository Structure
